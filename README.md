# Sign Language Recognition with Neural Network

Welcome to my Sign Language Recognition project! This project was developed as part of the Girls Who Code Self-Paced Program (SPP) 2024. I am passionate about this project because it leverages technology to address communication barriers. By improving sign language recognition, we can support individuals who rely on sign language to communicate, fostering inclusivity and accessibility.


## Project Overview

In this project, I developed a neural network model to classify American Sign Language (ASL) letters from images. The goal is to demonstrate how machine learning can be applied to real-world problems, particularly in helping individuals communicate more effectively.

### Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Load and normalize the Sign Language MNIST dataset.
- **Model Training**: Build and train an `MLPClassifier` to recognize ASL letters.
- **Evaluation**: Assess model performance using accuracy metrics and a confusion matrix.
- **Visualization**: Plot histograms and sample images from the dataset to better understand the data.
